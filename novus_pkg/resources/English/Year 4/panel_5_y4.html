<p>
Given the rapidly changing market segmentation and the increased likelihood of heightened competition from other breweries, activities that help raise awareness about your product will help to retain your existing customer base and also serve to attract new customers.

Community Development should always be a focus for an organization, especially once the business is profitable.
