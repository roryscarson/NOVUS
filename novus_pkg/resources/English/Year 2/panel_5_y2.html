<h1>Other Spending</h1>

<p>
While certain expenses, such as rent and staffing, are dependent on how much beer you are producing, there are other expense categories that are at your discretion. These include Marketing, Product Development, Promotional Activities, and Community Development. Marketing expense and Promotional Activities include actions related to advertising your product, including website development, print advertisements, television commercials, etc. as well as special events, contests, and prizes that provide incentives for customers to try your product. Marketing is very important for new beer competitors since it aids in consumer product awareness.

<p>
Product Development expense determines how much you spend on experimenting with the brewing process to develop a better-tasting beer. It may happen that consumers do not like the exact type of beer you brew, due to the types and amounts of ingredients used. An investment in Product Development will help tailor your beer to suit customers’ preferences and ensure the highest-quality beer relative your capabilities. Since you do not have any direct consumer feedback yet as it is your first year brewing, you think this might be an important expense.

Community Development expense is related to how much you give back to the citizens of Megapolis through community improvement projects and donations to local charitable organizations. It is important to help your community and it also serves to create a positive reputation for your business as being socially responsible.
</p>
<p>
Since these expenses should be set at a level that corresponds with the size of your business, you think each expense category should be tied to the forecasted revenue for the coming year. You need to decide the percentage of forecasted sales you will spend in each of these four areas.
