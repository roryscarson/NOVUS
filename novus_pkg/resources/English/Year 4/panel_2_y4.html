<p>
As you are considering another capital investment, you have also approached your bank about taking on additional long-term debt. Based on the success of your brewery over the past few years, they have again given you the option to borrow up to $2,000,000. The interest rate on the loan will depend on two factors: the amount withdrawn and how much your brewery has had to rely on the emergency line of credit the bank provided you when you first opened your brewery. The lowest available interest rate is 5.00%, with premiums added depending on these two factors. You need to decide if you would like to take on additional long-term debt and, if so, the amount.

<p>
You continue to have the option to utilize the short-term, asset-based line of credit that the bank offered you last year. If you decide not to use the line of credit this year, you will have to pay back whatever you used last year. However, you will not have to pay any interest expense. On the other hand, if you foresee some financing needs for your business, this line of credit is a relatively cheap way of funding new opportunities.
