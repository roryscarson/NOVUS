<h1>Other Spending</h1>

<p>
Marketing and Promotional Activities will always be important for a business, but in some cases businesses will try to increase their earnings by decreasing the annual amount spent on these segments; however, this may have the undesirable effect of decreasing consumer awareness about your product. In terms of Product Development, it is still important that your product fits consumer demand, but at this stage of the brewery’s life cycle, the brewing process should be well understood, assuming the same ingredients continue to be used. Community Development will be important regardless of the stage in your brewery’s life cycle, especially given the recent interest of beer consumers in taking care of their environment.
