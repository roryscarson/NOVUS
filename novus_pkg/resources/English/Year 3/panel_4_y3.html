<h1>Human Resources</h1>

<p>
As your brewery expends its operations and production volume grows, it is time to start thinking about what kind of staff you will need. In general, the types of roles necessary to operate a small brewery can be divided into three categories: executive management, sales and marketing, and brewing staff. 
</p>
<p>
The only potential addition to the executive management team would be a Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The responsibilities of the Chief Financial Officer include: developing the annual financial plan, providing internal and external financial reporting, preparing and filing tax reports, general office accounting, and providing the Chief Executive Officer with general advice about the financial health of the business. Typically, a CFO is hired when a brewery’s operations grow to a point where it is too difficult for the Chief Executive Officer to operate both the strategic and financial sides of the business. This usually occurs when annual sales of a brewery reach somewhere between $1,000,000 – $1,500,000.

The sales and marketing staff will consist of a Head of Marketing, a Customer Service Manager, and sales representatives. Similar to the CFO position, a Head of Marketing and Customer Service Manager are typically hired once the business grows to a certain size. To maintain positive sales growth, marketing activities need to be conducted effectively and intelligently. Both of these positions report to the Chief Executive Officer. Often, increased sales lead to a larger customer base, which requires more direct interaction and attention from the company. The Head of Marketing is usually hired around the same time as a CFO, while a Customer Service Manager is hired once annual sales reach $3,500,000 - $5,000,000. Sales representatives are needed to build and maintain good relationships with your customers. The sales force will increase as the brewery grows. Most experienced sales representatives can handle client relationships with a total annual purchasing power to lead to $2,500,000 - $4,000,000 in revenues for the brewery.

The brewing staff is the largest portion of your workforce and includes seven types of positions: brewing managers, assistant brewing managers, a Quality Control Specialist, beer brewers, beer packagers, truck drivers for beer distribution, and a cleaning staff. As opposed to the other parts of the staff, these positions largely depend on the quantity of beer produced annually. For the beer brewers, packagers, drivers, and cleaners, an easy way to approximate hiring needs is to look at how many cycles of beer you plan to produce. These are collectively called the general laborers. The number of managers and assistant managers will depend on how many general laborers you have. It is important to note that managers often have all the skills necessary to be a brewer, packager, or cleaner and can assist in these roles when needed if production volume is not high enough to warrant hiring someone for one of these specific positions.
</p>
<p>
On average, brewers and packagers work a maximum of 1,000 hours per year. In order to estimate the number of brewers and packagers needed, you must look at the brewing process flow chart to figure out how much labor is necessary to brew one batch of beer. The second step is to convert the number of days into hours, assuming that each day equates to eight hours of work. Recall that your managers will have likely been trained as brewers and at lower production volumes can handle the brewing process themselves. However, packaging is a necessary step that requires someone to perform the function whether you brew one batch or a hundred. The necessity for drivers is related to the annual distribution capacity of a truck. On average, a truck can handle 30 deliveries per month and is able to transport 5,000 liters of packaged beer per trip. You need at least one driver for each truck. Cleaners are responsible for sanitizing the brewing equipment after each cycle, though the brewers themselves can sometimes complete this function. Once annual cycles reach 25-30, it is probably time to hire a separate cleaner.

The number of managers and assistant managers will depend on how many brewers, packagers, drivers, and cleaners you decide to hire. One manager is often capable of overseeing 4 - 7 employees. One assistant manager is often needed once the number of general laborers reaches 9 – 12 so that they can help the manager with the administrative workload. A Quality Control Specialist does not manage any people, but is responsible for ensuring that the brewing process meets industry standards, uses quality ingredients, and that each batch is consistent in terms of taste. Once the production level reaches a point where a brewer needs to be hired, it is probably prudent to hire a Quality Control Specialist. Each year after you’ve completed your production forecast, you need to decide how many people to hire across these 11 positions.
