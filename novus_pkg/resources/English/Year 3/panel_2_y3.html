<h2><b><u>Short-Term Financing Decision Point</u></b></h2>

<p>
Your bank has approached you to discuss short-term financing options to help your brewery grow. Now that you have one year of successful production and sales, you have proved to the bank that you operate a sustainable business. The bank has offered you an asset-based line of credit to help with short-term financing needs. With positive sales, you now have assets such as Accounts Receivable, Finished Goods Inventory, and Equipment. The bank will use these assets as collateral for your line of credit, if you decide to use it. Like many lines of credit, the bank uses the discounted value of these assets from your latest financial statements to set the limit you may borrow under the line of credit. The bank discounts their book value to protect itself in the case that it must sell off these assets to pay back its loan if your business fails. Because this financing is considered short-term and is collateralized by specific assets, the interest rates are relatively low. If you borrow less than 50% of the maximum amount, the annual interest rate is 3.50%; if you borrow more, the rate is 6.50%. The bank has told you that it will keep this line of credit open for your business for the next five years at these rates. You need to decide if you are going to use this financing option this year and, if so, how much you will borrow.
