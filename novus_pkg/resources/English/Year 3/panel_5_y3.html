<h1>Other Spending</h1>

<p>
Similar to the previous year, Marketing, Product Development, Promotional Activities, and Community Development are all discretionary expenses for your business. You should consider a few factors that may impact your business in the coming year before deciding how much to spend in these categories. First, you will likely face increased competition from other breweries. Second, if there are more people eating out at restaurants and bars, there is an increased opportunity to raise awareness about your product. Third, depending on how well your brewery performed last year, consumers may be content with your beer quality, though improvements are always welcomed. Finally, community development will never cease to be important; to the extent that other categories are changed, any cash savings could be redeployed to serving Megapolis.
