Last year, 32.8 million liters of beer were consumed in Megapolis. Lagers and stouts accounted for 33% of the total consumption, with ales accounting for 67%. While one ale machine run at full capacity (1.5 million liters) could account for up to 5.2% of the total demand three years ago (28.8 million liters of ale consumed), due to the changes in consumer demand this same capacity would have accounted for 6.8% last year (22 million liters of ale consumed). More drastically, a lager machineâ€™s maximum production capacity (900,000 liters per year) would have accounted for over 56% of total demand three years ago (1.6 million liters of lager consumed), but only 12% last year (7.5 million liters of lager consumed). The following graphs illustrate these differences:

As your business continues to grow, you are considering purchasing additional brewing and packaging equipment. In your current warehouse, you have the space to hold up to five brewing machines. You have approached the same vendor that you did three years ago and have been told that a large quantity of both ale and lager brewing equipments are available. Since you are a repeat customer, the vendor is offering you the same price per machine: $100,000. The capacity of each machine is the same: 100,000 liters per cycle. If you have the capacity to purchase additional machines, you should again consider the current demand levels for lagers and ales and the overall annual beer consumption. Before deciding if and what machines to purchase, you should read the information included in the Production Volume section. Note that an increase in machinery will also lead to an increase in rent, since you will have to pay for the additional floor space.

In addition to brewing equipment, the vendor has also asked about your packaging equipment. If you are not already packaging kegs, bottles, and cans, you have the opportunity now to purchase the necessary equipment. The prices are the same as they were in Year 1.

<p>
When you notified your landlord of the possibility of purchasing additional machinery, he brought up the possibility of adjusting your Finished Goods Storage Space. Recall that this is based on a percentage of your maximum annual output. You can decide to leave the percentage the same as your initial decision or adjust it if you feel you have too much or too little space.
