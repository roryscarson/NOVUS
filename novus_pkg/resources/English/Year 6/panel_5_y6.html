<h1>Other Spending</h1>

<p>
Marketing, Product Development, and Promotional Activities will always be important for a business, but in some cases businesses will try to increase their earnings by decreasing the annual spend on these segments. Community Development will be important regardless of the stage in your brewery’s life cycle, since it creates a positive reputation for your business.
