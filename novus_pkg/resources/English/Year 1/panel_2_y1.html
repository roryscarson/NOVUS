<h1>Financing</h1>

<p>
Now that you have decided how much you are investing in machinery and estimated your annual rental cost, you should start thinking about how much financial capital you will need to get your brewery started.
</p>
In addition to the capital investment and rental expense, there are other costs and factors to consider. First, you should consider that most new businesses do not make a financial profit for the first few years of operation. In other words, your business will probably be cash flow negative in the near future. Second, there are additional costs that your business will incur. During the next year, you will be focused on constructing the brewery and ensuring that all the machinery is functional. You have determined that you can do all of this work yourself, so your salary will be the only expense during the first year. You do not expect to produce or sell any beer in the first year. However, you will begin production next year, which will require you to build up a full-time staff as your production volume grows. There are also other expenses that will be minimal in the first year, but will grow as time passes and you begin production. These include utilities (gas, electricity, water, phone, internet), fuel expense (for distributing the finished beer to your customers), marketing expense, product development expense, promotional activities expenses, and community development expense. You also plan to invest $50,000 this year in general office equipment such as computers and furniture.
<p>
Now you must decide how much and what mix of debt and equity financing you will pursue to fund your brewery until you begin making a profit. You have spoken to your local bank about debt financing options. The bank has agreed to let you borrow up to $2,000,000 in the form of a long-term loan. However, the amount borrowed will affect the interest rate and how quickly you must pay back the loan. As the amount increases, the bank assumes more risk that you and your business might not be able to pay back the loan. The interest rate for your long-term loan may range anywhere from 8-14%, depending on the amount you decide to borrow. Additionally, since you have significant ties to the community and personal assets to serve as collateral, the bank has agreed to supply you with a line of credit. This line of credit has much higher interest rates (up to 22%) so you decide that this will be your emergency source of funding in the event that you run out of money from other sources.

In addition to these debt options, you have gathered the financial support of your friends and family. Along with your personal savings, you have been able to gather commitments to invest up to $1,500,000 in your business. While there is no interest expense for this type of equity financing, you give up some control of your business by having many investors. Investors expect to have a vote in the direction of your business since it was their money that helped start it. Since these investors are mostly close friends and family, you don’t expect there to be too much trouble but it is something you should be aware of.

<p>
First, you need to estimate your total financing need. It is always nice to have extra cash around, but there can also be problems with raising too much capital for a new business. If you take on too much debt, you will be paying more interest expense than you need to. If you take on too much equity, you might have people trying to manage your business or take it in a different strategic direction. However, no business can succeed without financial resources, so you also want to make sure you have enough cash to get you through the next few years until you will hopefully be making a financial profit.

<p>
After you have figured out how much cash you need, the next step is think about what mix of debt and equity you are going to use. You decide to analyze the financial statements of other breweries to see what their financing strategy has been. By looking at their balance sheets, you can see how much debt financing each brewery has compared to how much equity financing they have used. Using the relationship of debt financing to equity financing in the most recent year, you find that, on average, most brewers have about $0.50 of debt financing for every $1.00 of equity financing. For each brewery you analyzed, you also decide to look at their financial records for the last five years to see if this same ratio was followed. You have found that for every $1.00 of equity capital, other breweries have had anywhere from $0.30 - $0.80 of debt financing. While there seems to be some variability, looking at the trends of your competitors helps give you an idea of what financing strategy you should use for your brewery. You decide that you should use a mix of debt and equity capital to fund your brewery, but need to decide how much of each is the appropriate amount.
